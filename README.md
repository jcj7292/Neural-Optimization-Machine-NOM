# Neural Optimization Machine (NOM)

This software package implements the Neural Optimization Machine (NOM) for constrained optimization of neural network models.

The package provides NOM codes for four numerical optimization problems (three single objective optimization and a multi-objective optimization) and a design problem in additive manufacturing.

The following paper describes the details of the NOM:
